# SK-CERT-CYBERGAME-2024

# Introduction
This is another year of excellent CTF game organized by support from SK-CERT and NBU. More info about the game and the rules: https://cybergame.sk-cert.sk/

This year I did not participate as much as I would liked to and from what little I did try to solve - was, in my opinion, more difficult than last year - and much more FUN!

As in previous write-ups, idea is to preserve the knowledge I gained while trying to solve various tasks encountered in the game. I find it useful if I document each step I took in the right direction to solve the challenge, which helps me later solving similar problems. 

# Contents

Structure of this repository matches the categories and challenges within each category.
As I did not manage to unlock every challenge, I didn't describe all the scenarios and tasks, if there is an error somewhere or something is missing, I will be happy if you write to me or contribute via pull request.
